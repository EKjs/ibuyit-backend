# ibuyit (backend part)

This is an Express-based backend Node.js application to get data from SQL DB and to serve it to the frontend via REST API.

_"I buy it"_ is my small WBS-CS graduation project. It is a small website to buy and sell things, where you can also register as a Farmer or a local small business.
